                Hello! My name is Jude Wilson, I am a 17 year old soon to be high school senior from Dayton, Ohio! I
                currently attend Bethel High School in Miami County!
            </p>
            <p class="about">
                I am interested in a few main things: photogrpahy, computer science, health, and people! These things
                seem a
                little random and they are, but I have reason for all of them!
            </p>
            <p class="about">
                I love photography because a camera can
                capture a beaitful moment forever, and who doesnt want that?
            </p>
            <p class="about">
                I love computer science because I find it
                fun! I self taught myself Lua in 6th grade so I could make ROBLOX games!
            </p>
            <p class="about">
                I am also a gym rat, I have
                gone to the gym almost every day for the past two years! I compete every once in a while in local
                powerlifting meets and try to run as much as possible!
            </p>
            <p class="about">
                Lastly, I love people; I love
                talking to people, learning about them, and talking with them. This is the reason I curretly work in
                sales and want to work in real estate after graduation.
            </p>
            <p class="about">
                And now you know who I am!
